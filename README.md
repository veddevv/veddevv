# Hey, I'm Matheo!
I have been coding since 2024.
Linux user since 2022; The first Distro i used was Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish, now i use [CachyOS](https://cachyos.org/) on my Gaming laptop, Debian on old gaming PC (2018), and MacOS Ventura 12.7.4 on an old mid-2014 macbook pro.

I just mess around with Python scripts and C++ stuff.

I've also translated [Jazz² Resurrection](https://github.com/deathkiller/jazz2-native) to Norwegian!


## What I'm working on right now
- [RoPY](https://github.com/notrtdsx/RoPY) - Shows info about a user on roblox by their User ID via the Roblox API. (for example, my User ID is (https://www.roblox.com/users/2031224455/profile)[2031224455])
- [vgde](https://github.com/notrtdsx/vgde) - Shows info about games available on the RAWG site via their API
