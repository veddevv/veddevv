# Hey, I'm Matheo!
I have been coding since 2024.
Linux user since 2022; The first Distro i used was Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish, now i use [CachyOS](https://cachyos.org/) and MacOS.
I just mess around with Python scripts and C++ stuff.

I've also translated [Jazz² Resurrection](https://github.com/deathkiller/jazz2-native) to Norwegian!
